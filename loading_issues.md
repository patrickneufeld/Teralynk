# Workflow Loading Issues Resolution

The getWorkflows functionality was failing due to several issues:

1. **Data Flow Issues**:
   - Backend wasn't properly returning the rows from PostgreSQL queries
   - Frontend wasn't properly handling the response format
   - Variable name mismatch in workflow creation response

2. **Required Setup**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
   - Create a .env file based on .env.example with your database credentials
   - Create the workflows table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE workflows (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       description TEXT,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
       deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
   );
   ```

3. **Running the Application**:
   - Start the backend: `cd backend && npm start`
   - Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`
   - Access the application at http://localhost:3000

4. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Check browser console for frontend errors
   - Check backend logs for database connection issues
   - Ensure CORS settings match your environment
   - Verify database connection string in .env file
