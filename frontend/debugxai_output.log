Let's analyze the errors and suggest fixes:

1. **Error 1: No matching export in "src/components/ui/Button.jsx" for import "Button"**

   The error indicates that you are trying to import `Button` from `src/components/ui/Button.jsx`, but there is no matching export for `Button` in that file.

   **Fix:**
   - Open `src/components/ui/Button.jsx`.
   - Ensure that `Button` is exported correctly. It should look something like this:

     ```jsx
     export const Button = ({ children, ...props }) => {
       // Button component implementation
     };
     ```

     or

     ```jsx
     export function Button({ children, ...props }) {
       // Button component implementation
     };
     ```

     or if it's a default export:

     ```jsx
     export default function Button({ children, ...props }) {
       // Button component implementation
     };
     ```

   - If it's a default export, change the import in `src/components/Notifications.jsx` to:

     ```jsx
     import Button from "../components/ui/Button";
     ```

2. **Error 2: No matching export in "src/components/ui/Select.jsx" for import "SelectItem"**

   Similarly, you are trying to import `SelectItem` from `src/components/ui/Select.jsx`, but there is no matching export for `SelectItem` in that file.

   **Fix:**
   - Open `src/components/ui/Select.jsx`.
   - Ensure that `SelectItem` is exported correctly. It should look something like this:

     ```jsx
     export const SelectItem = ({ children, ...props }) => {
       // SelectItem component implementation
     };
     ```

     or

     ```jsx
     export function SelectItem({ children, ...props }) {
       // SelectItem component implementation
     };
     ```

   - If `SelectItem` is not meant to be exported from `Select.jsx`, you need to import it from wherever it is actually exported. For example, if it's in a separate file `SelectItem.jsx`, you would do:

     ```jsx
     import Select from "../components/ui/Select";
     import { SelectItem } from "../components/ui/SelectItem";
     ```

3. **Additional Note:**

   The error message also mentions a failure to scan for dependencies from `index.html`. This could be related to how your build process is configured. Make sure that your `index.html` file is correctly set up in your build configuration, and that all the paths to your JavaScript files are correct.

   If you're using a tool like `esbuild`, ensure that your build script correctly references `index.html` and that all paths to your JavaScript files are correct.

After making these changes, try rebuilding your project. If you encounter any further issues, please provide the updated error messages, and I'll be happy to help further.
