# Logging System Migration

## Summary of Changes

Amazon Q helped migrate the Teralynk frontend project from multiple disparate logging utilities to a unified logging system. This migration:

1. **Consolidated multiple logging utilities** into a single, comprehensive system
2. **Added rate limiting** to prevent log flooding
3. **Improved error handling** to avoid recursive logging loops
4. **Standardized the logging API** across the entire application
5. **Removed redundant code** by eliminating multiple overlapping utilities

## Key Files Created

- `/src/utils/logging/index.js` - The main unified logging system
- `/src/utils/logging/ErrorBoundary.jsx` - Updated error boundary component
- `/src/utils/logging/README.md` - Documentation for the new system
- `/src/utils/logging/migration.md` - Migration guide

## Files Removed

- `/src/utils/logger.js`
- `/src/utils/ErrorHandler.js`
- `/src/utils/loggingService.js`
- `/src/utils/auditLogger.js`
- `/src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx`

## Migration Process

1. Created a unified logging system with rate limiting and improved error handling
2. Updated the main entry point to use the new system
3. Created migration scripts to automate the transition
4. Executed the migration scripts to update imports and function calls
5. Removed the old logging files

## Benefits

- **Reduced code duplication** by consolidating multiple logging utilities
- **Prevented logging loops** that could cause performance issues
- **Improved error tracking** with consistent error IDs and formatting
- **Added rate limiting** to prevent log flooding in error scenarios
- **Simplified maintenance** with a single system to update and extend

## Next Steps

- Monitor the application for any logging issues
- Consider adding integration with external logging services (e.g., Sentry, Datadog)
- Extend the logging system with additional features as needed
