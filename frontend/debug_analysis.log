        "content": "Based on the errors provided, it appears that there are multiple issues related to import resolution and missing exports in your frontend project. Let's analyze the errors and provide a detailed solution:\n\n1. Missing exports in component files:\n   - The errors indicate that there are no matching exports for \"Button\" in \"src/components/ui/Button.jsx\" and \"SelectItem\" in \"src/components/ui/Select.jsx\".\n   - This suggests that the export statements in these files do not match the import statements in \"src/components/Notifications.jsx\".\n\n2. Unresolved imports:\n   - There are multiple errors related to unresolved imports, specifically for \"../ui/Button\" and \"../ui/Card\".\n   - These errors occur in files \"src/components/AITools.jsx\" and \"src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx\".\n\n3. Possible file structure issues:\n   - The errors suggest that the file structure might not match the import paths used in the code.\n\nTo resolve these issues, follow these steps:\n\n1. Check and fix exports in component files:\n   - Open \"src/components/ui/Button.jsx\" and ensure it has an export for \"Button\". It should look something like this:\n\n     ```jsx\n     export function Button(props) {\n       // Button component implementation\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - Similarly, open \"src/components/ui/Select.jsx\" and ensure it has an export for \"SelectItem\":\n\n     ```jsx\n     export function SelectItem(props) {\n       // SelectItem component implementation\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. Verify import paths and file structure:\n   - The unresolved import errors suggest that the file structure might not match the import paths. Check the following:\n     - Ensure that \"src/components/ui/Button.jsx\" exists and is correctly named.\n     - Ensure that \"src/components/ui/Card.jsx\" exists and is correctly named.\n     - Verify that the import paths in \"src/components/AITools.jsx\" and \"src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx\" are correct. They should be:\n\n       ```jsx\n       import Button from \"../components/ui/Button\";\n       import { Card, CardContent } from \"../components/ui/Card\";\n       ```\n\n3. Update import statements:\n   - In \"src/components/Notifications.jsx\", update the import statements to match the exports in the respective files:\n\n     ```jsx\n     import { Button } from \"../components/ui/Button\";\n     import Select, { SelectItem } from \"../components/ui/Select\";\n     ```\n\n4. Check for typos and case sensitivity:\n   - Ensure that all file names, component names, and import statements have consistent naming and are case-sensitive.\n\n5. Clear cache and restart the development server:\n   - After making these changes, clear any cached build artifacts and restart your development server to ensure the changes take effect.\n\n6. Use absolute imports:\n   - To avoid relative path issues, consider configuring your build tool (Vite in this case) to use absolute imports. Add the following to your `vite.config.js`:\n\n     ```javascript\n     import { defineConfig } from 'vite';\n     import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';\n\n     export default defineConfig({\n       plugins: [react()],\n       resolve: {\n         alias: [\n           { find: '@', replacement: '/src' },\n         ],\n       },\n     });\n     ```\n\n     Then, update your import statements to use absolute paths:\n\n     ```jsx\n     import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';\n     import { Card, CardContent } from '@/components/ui/Card';\n     ```\n\n7. Verify file existence and permissions:\n   - Ensure that all referenced files exist and are accessible by the build process.\n\n8. Check for circular dependencies:\n   - Make sure there are no circular dependencies in your import structure, as these can cause resolution issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import and export issues in your project. If the errors persist after implementing these solutions, you may need to investigate further, possibly looking at your build configuration or other project-specific settings.",
